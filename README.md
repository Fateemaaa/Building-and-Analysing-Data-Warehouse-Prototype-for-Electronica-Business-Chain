# Building-and-Analysing-Data-Warehouse-Prototype-for-Electronica-Business-Chain
Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence 

Identifying appropriate dimension tables, fact tables, and their attributes for the sales
scenario. Based on that, creating a star-schema for DW with appropriate primary and
foreign keys. To keep the attribute name and their data types consistent in DW, consult the
attributes list of both transactional and master data. Also use â€œELECTRONICA-DW'' as a
name for the database where star-schema will be created.
2. Loading date Dimension table in the form of calendar using Java. i.e. all dates from year
2019.
3. Implementing the HYBRIDJOIN algorithm using Java and successfully loading transactional
data into DW after joining it with MD.
4. Applying different analysis (described in Section 8) on DW using slicing, dicing, drill down,
and materialized view concepts.
